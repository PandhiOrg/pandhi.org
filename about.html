                        <p>
                            <strong class="text-uppercase">The Mahim Pandhi Wildlife Foundation</strong> was founded to
                            fill the void of conservation and
                            protection of the native reptiles of Kutch, a unique, isolated part of India. With our
                            flagship project DesertCrocs, we are working towards better understanding of the unique
                            crocodiles of Kutch. We also work with local communities on educational initiatives to help
                            continue the zero human-crocodile conflict legacy of Kutch, and better understand this
                            fascinating aspect of co-existence to help other communities at large.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our prime directive is to study crocodiles while taking the utmost care to preserve their
                            safety, territory, and way of life. Our secondary directive is to assume nothing, and
                            observe with fresh eyes. We employ cutting edge technologies and inventive methodologies
                            that stray from mainstream to explore alternative ways of researching crocodiles.

                        <h2>A different approach to charity</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Foundation is different from charitable organizations and NGOs, in that it is fully
                            self-sufficient and operates on a private budget, without any financial contributions from
                            donors or sponsors. We believe many organizations often drown in politics and bureaucracy
                            when monetary concerns become more important than doing the work the organization was meant
                            to perform. Having a private operational budget leaves us free to focus exclusively on our
                            research projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To foster open exchange with other researchers, The Foundation publishes its research and
                            data under the highly permissive <a

                        <p>
                            DesertCrocs&rsquo; prime directive is to
                            study crocodiles while taking the utmost care to preserve their safety,
                            territory, and way of life. Our
                            secondary directive is to assume nothing, and observe with fresh eyes. Our tertiary
                            directive is to employ cutting-edge
                            yet affordable technology to achieve our goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To avoid problems caused by politics, organizational hierarchies, and finances, DesertCrocs
                            is a different kind of endeavor.
                            We are a small team of volunteers, armed with cutting edge technology and an undying passion
                            for crocodiles. This project is fully self funded. Approaching the research from a unique
                            point of view, we aim to make new, unbiased observations and hunches.

                                    The Foundation was created in memory of Mahim Pandhi, a renowned journalist and
                                    renaissance
                                    man who loved nature. He spent his life practicing his principles of charity and
                                    philanthropy. He was a man of action who believed in doing things himself rather
                                    than
                                    delegating - especially when it came to helping others. He shared his garden with
                                    cobras,
                                    mongoooses, and reptiles.
