                        <p>
                            Like in most other places where crocodiles exist, rapid and unabated development is
                            permanently destroying these animals' habitat. In a desert environment, water becomes a very
                            precious resource - one both humans and animals both vie for, but humans have a distinct
                            advantage over the animals. Legal and illegal pumping of water from reservoirs small and
                            big, as well as natural dams reduces the few water bodies available to the crocodiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This forces them to seek new habitats, often bringing them into residential areas or farms
                            where they become prey to fear and are sometimes killed outright. Other times they end up as
                            roadkill on highways.

                        <p>
                            Extreme climate changes multiply these threats as water becomes very scarce with longer
                            summers and shorter periods of rain which are becoming more and more sporadic.

                            Rapid loss of water during hatching season expose nests to predators to a degree that would
                            be considered beyond the "nature's limit".

                        <p>
                            Kutch presents another unique aspect for studying crocodilian
                            behavior: a supremely clean record when it coms to human-crocodile conflicts. There had been
                            <a
                                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322078703_Review_and_analysis_of_human_and_Mugger_Crocodile_conflict_in_Gujarat_India_from_1960_to_2013">only
                                one recorded incident of a fatal incident related to Muggers in Kutch between 1960 and
                                2013</a>, and even that had been later marked as questionable by local authorities as
                            the person was suspected to have drowned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relationship between people and crocodiles in Kutch is a vey healthy one, where humans
                            have shown great respect towards the reptiles and left them alone. Local crocodile
                            populations even garner affection from their human neighbors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a very important aspect of crocodilian life, and a pillar of our research.

                        <h2>Employing cutting edge technology</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have developed techniques specifically adapted to the local biome and climate to use
                            satellite imagery to identify crocodile sites with a very high level of accuracy. This is
                            very important because a vast majority of crocodile habitats in Kutch are not easily
                            accessible, and the distance between water bodies can range from a few hundred
                            meters to several kilometers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By predicting habitats and seasonal movements using open source satellite data, we can
                            accurately find and observe crocodiles populations - even previously undiscovered ones.

                            Using drones for high altitude observation provides a unique way to observe the animals in
                            their habitat without disturbing them. Using advanced methods, even subsurface observation
                            is possible, revealing the hidden world of crocodiles beneath the water's surface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Advanced imaging and processing methods are used to identify and tag crocodiles from aerial
                            observation points, revealing individuals - and even patterns of behavior - that may
                            extremely difficult to spot from the ground.

                        <p>
                            Instead of extrapolating the population density based on a finite set of samples, we
                            can achieve a much more accurate count. Such techniques have allowed us to identify 256+
                            individuals across 6,558,700m<sup>2</sup>. Repeat observations reveal behavior and movement
                            patterns without intruding on the animals.

                                We are at the end of the first phase of our research. We have uncovered many interesting
