                        <p>
                            Like in most other places where crocodiles exist, rapid and unabated development is
                            permanently destroying these animals' habitat. In a desert environment, water becomes a very
                            precious resource - one both humans and animals both vie for.

                        <h2>Seasonal Extremes</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kutch receives less than adequate rainfall most years, and in the summer temperature often
                            rises above 45&deg; C.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Climate change multiplies these threats as water becomes very scarce with longer, hotter
                            summers and shorter, sporadic periods of rain.

                            Kutch is an island. Isolated from the North and East by desert and salt marshes, and the
                            Indian ocean from the South and West.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All crocodile populations in this region are, and have been, isolated for a very long time.

                        <h2>An unfair fight</h2>
                        <p>
                            Even though a desert, Kutch is significantly over-farmed. Legal and illegal pumping of
                            reservoirs small and large, as well as natural dams and ponds reduces the few water bodies
                            available to the crocodiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This forces them to seek new habitats, often bringing them into residential areas or farms
                            where they become prey to fear and are sometimes killed outright. Other times they end up as
                            roadkill on highways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These unnatural and rapid water level changes creates a major threat - undue exposure of
                            nests. With their nests becoming accessible to feral dogs and other predators. Crocodiles
                            babies have an extremely high mortality rate, and such exposure dramatically reduces the
                            hatchlings' chances for survival. Such mortality rates could be considered well beyond the
                            "natural limit" for these apex predators.

                        <p>
                            Kutch presents another unique aspect for studying crocodilian
                            behavior: a supremely clean record when it comes to human-crocodile conflicts. There had
                            been
                            <a
                                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322078703_Review_and_analysis_of_human_and_Mugger_Crocodile_conflict_in_Gujarat_India_from_1960_to_2013">only
                                one recorded incident of a fatal incident related to Muggers in Kutch between 1960 and
                                2013</a>, and even that had been later marked as questionable by local authorities as
                            the person was suspected to have drowned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relationship between people and crocodiles in Kutch is a very healthy one, where humans
                            living next to them have shown great respect towards the reptiles. Local crocodile
                            populations even garner affection from some of their human neighbors.

                        <h2>Employing cutting edge technology</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have developed techniques specifically adapted to the local biome and climate to use
                            satellite imagery to identify crocodile sites with a very high level of accuracy. This is
                            very important because a vast majority of crocodile habitats in Kutch are not easily
                            accessible, and the distance between water bodies can range from a few hundred
                            meters to several kilometers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By predicting habitats and seasonal movements using open source satellite data, we can
                            accurately find and observe crocodiles populations - even previously undiscovered ones.
                        </p>

                            Using drones for high altitude observation provides a unique way to observe the animals in
                            their habitat without disturbing them. Using advanced methods, even subsurface observation
                            is possible, revealing the hidden world of crocodiles beneath the water's surface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Advanced imaging and processing methods are used to identify and tag crocodiles from aerial
                            observation points, revealing individuals - and even patterns of behavior - that may prove
                            extremely difficult to spot from the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of extrapolating the population density based on a finite set of samples, we
                            can achieve a much more accurate count. Such techniques have allowed us to identify 256+
                            individuals across 6,558,700m<sup>2</sup>. Repeat observations reveal behavior and movement
                            patterns without intruding on the animals.
