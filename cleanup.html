                            Several large crocodile populations exist in water bodies next to temples. For certain
                            religious festivals, processions go to water bodies to immerse ornately decorated idols -
                            often made with plaster and toxic paints. Other times small urns and clay pots adorned with
                            synthetic strings, cloth, and other items are left in the water with offerings. Quite often
                            these items are produced under questionable toxic conditions to keep costs low.

                            water directly, while other times if left uncleaned on land, winds will carry them into the
                            water.

                            stagnant, and contamination spreads too easily in these waters.

                            We are organizing cleanup several different efforts with help from volunteers to cleanup water bodies in the summer when the water level is low, and the garbage is safely exposed. It also creates added safety for both the cleanup crews and the crocodiles, as the crocodiles always remain in the water which would be far from the exposed shore.

                            Cleaning up is simply a stop gap measure. Educating people is the key to preventing further

                            Through 2020, we will organize public education initiatives to help convey the importance of
                            wildlife and water bodies.
